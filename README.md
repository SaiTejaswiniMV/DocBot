# DocBot

An  Artificial Intelligence  technology, that provides  apt and novel solutions for improving clinical assistance and promoting better patient outcomes. An excellent technology for medical diagnosis and providing proper medications.

This project is a simulation of how MYCIN works on the small scale using the concepts of state space search, expert systems and to some extent, a very basic level of  Natural Language Processing. The diseases, along with their symptoms and their medication are stored in a database. Given the situation of no disease as initial state, to the goal state of having some disease. The algorithm uses state space search to traverse through the diseases and their symptoms with the constant interrogation and conversation with the patient, reaches to the goal state of confirming or identifying  the disease and providing proper medication .It uses expert system ,as per the past conversation and with stored database of diseases and symptoms ,expert system helps in diagnosing and rejecting some disease which does not match the symptoms of the patient.
